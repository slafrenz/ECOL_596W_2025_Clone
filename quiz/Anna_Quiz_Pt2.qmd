## Part 2: Coding in action

### Instructions

Please answer these questions in R using whatever syntax makes sense to you. Feel free to use the R help pages and/or notes from class.

**If you use Google or ChatGPT etc. to help you get to an answer, please note so on your answer**

Submit your answers as an html file. Name it "lastname_quiz1.html". Two submission options:\
1. Create a branch in your forked-and-cloned class repo. Add the html file to the student_contributions/ folder. Submit a pull request to Sabrina (preferred); 2. Email it to mcnew\@arizona.edu (if github is really giving you a headache)

```{r, message = F}
# load packages and data 
library(ggplot2)
library(dslabs)
library(dplyr)
```

#### Load your data:

Load the *swallows.csv* into R, call it swallows. This data frame lists results of an experiment on tree swallows. Each row is a nest. Nests were put into one of two **treatments**: simulated predation (predator), or control (control). Along with treatment you have the following columns:\
**nest_fate** = whether the nest fledged any young or whether they all died\
**brood** = number of nestlings\
**n_fledged** = number of nestlings that fledged.

You also have a separate data frame called *brightness.csv* where each row lists the plumage brightness (a sexual signal) for the female at each nest. Load this one up too.

```{r}
# Answer 
swallows <- read.csv("swallows.csv")

# Google? y/n



```

#### Wrangle your data

You realize that you want to add brightness information onto your main swallows data frame. Join these data frames using nest_id as your key variable. Describe how you would check to make sure this join worked as intended.undefined

```{r}
#Answer



#Google? 


```

Inspect your combined data frame. Do some sort of quick sanity check on each column to catch any obvious entry errors. Correct as necessary

```{r}
# Answer

# Google y/n 
```

Create a new column called prop_fledged that contains the proportion of nestlings that fledged from each nest.

```{r}
#Answer

# Google? y/n

```

#### Explore the data

What was the mean proportion of nestlings fledged in each treatment?

```{r}
# Answer 


# Google? y/n

```

Create a plot showing fledging success differences between treatments

```{r}
# Answer

# Google? y/n


```

Is there any evidence that female brightness influenced fledging success? Create a plot to visually investigate this question.

```{r}
# Answer

# Google? y/n

```
